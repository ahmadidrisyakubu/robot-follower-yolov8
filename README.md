# robot-follower-yolov8
This project uses ROS 2 Humble and YOLOv8 for a robot follower system. It detects and tracks a person in real time, calculates distances using depth camera data, and controls the robot's motion to follow or stop based on proximity. Features include precise velocity control, smooth movement, and RViz visualization for target tracking.
